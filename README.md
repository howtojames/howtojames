### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is James. I am a graduate with a degree in Applied Mathematics and a Minor in Computer Science, overcoming many challenges along my academic journey. This journey shaped my resilience and will to never give up, setting the tone for my path into software engineering. The switch happened when I recognized the field's demand for consistent organization and preparation, which aligns with my values for work ethic. At App Academy, I developed important technical skills such as React and Redux, backend frameworks such as Express and Flask, and git workflow in a team environment. Alongside these, my adaptability, ability to meet deadlines, and a passion for improvement stands out. 

Enjoying the process of planning page layouts and producing them in code, I take pride in my capstone project, which blends all of my cumulative technical knowledge with a touch of creativity. I'm on the lookout for opportunities with companies using technologies Iâ€™m familiar with such as React, Javascript, and Python, and Iâ€™m also eager to learn new ones. Beyond tech, my interest lies in self-growth, which seamlessly compliments my professional career, creating a feedback relationship that enriches both my work and life.
